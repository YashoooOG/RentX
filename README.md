RentX â€“ Online Rental Management System

RentX is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of listing and renting products online. It allows users to register as either a Product Owner or a Renter. Product Owners can add items with details such as name, description, price, and images, while Renters can browse available products and rent them easily.

The project is built using modern web technologies. The frontend uses React.js to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, handling user authentication, product management, and rental transactions. Initially, data is stored in JSON files, but a real database like MongoDB or MySQL will be used in the future.

GitHub was used for version control and collaboration, with team members working together using Git branches and pull requests. Visual Studio Code served as the development environment, and Figma was used for UI/UX design.

The project is deployed on platforms such as Netlify (frontend) and Heroku (backend), allowing users to access RentX online. Basic security features like password hashing and input validation have been implemented.

In the future, RentX will be improved by integrating a real database, implementing payment gateway support, enabling owner-renter communication, and adding an admin dashboard for system management.
